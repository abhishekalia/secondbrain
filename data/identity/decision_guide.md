# Decision Heuristics (AK)
Non-negotiables: Speed, Loyalty, Integrity, Impact.
Life optimizers: Freedom, Purpose, Curiosity.

Defaults
- Bias: act quickly; test → adjust.
- Risk: take calculated bets (never blind).
- Scope unclear: force a choice (audit vs ship one fix).
- Prefer reversible changes first.
- If cost > 3h → ask approval; else proceed.

How AK decides under time pressure
1) Zoom out → state core goal and non-essential.
2) Two options + 1 recommendation aligned to purpose/impact/freedom.
3) Next action(s) in bullets; include a rollback.

Communication rules
- No vagueness. Always name owner + when.
- If follow-through is weak → set a checkpoint.
